    <h2>HTML TAGS</h2>
    <PRE>
    <b>Header Tags:</b>
         h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 are used to define HTML headings.
         h1 defines the most important heading.
         h6 defines the least important heading.
    <b>Void element or Self closing element:</b> 
         A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed 
         manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a seperate closing tag.
         EX: &lt;input/&gt;, &lt;hr/&gt;, &lt;br/&gt;, &lt;img/&gt;
    <b>&lt;p&gt; Tag:</b> 
         The tag is used to represent a paragraph which means a group of sentences.
    <b>&lt;b&gt; Tag:</b>
         &lt;b&gt; Tag is used to display the written text in bold format.
         It does not have real semantic meaning. 
    <b>&lt;Strong&gt; Tag:</b> 
         The strong tag is used to indicate that the text within it is important or 
         should be emphasized. 
    <b>&lt;i&gt; Tag:</b>
         The italic tag is a span of text that represents a change in quality of text.
    <b>&lt;em&gt; Tag:</b>
         The emphasis tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is
         typically displayed in italic.
    <b>&lt;sup&gt; Tag:</b>
         The &lt;sup&gt; tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character 
         above the normal line, and is sometimes redered in a smaller font.
    <b>&lt;sub&gt; Tag:</b>
         The &lt;sub&gt; tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character 
         below the normal line, and is sometimes redered in a smaller font.
    <b>&lt;mark&gt; Tag:</b> 
         It is used to highlight some part of the text for quick reference inside another element
         such as in a paragraph that is of more importance or relevance to the user.
    <b>&lt;del&gt; Tag:</b> 
         The &lt;del&gt; tag is used to identify text that has been deleted from a document but 
         retained to show the history of modifications made to the document.
    <b>&lt;ins&gt; Tag:</b> 
         The &lt;ins&gt; tag defines a text that has been inserted into a document. 
         Browsers will usually underline inserted text.
    <b>&lt;u&gt; Tag:</b>
         The &lt;u&gt; tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal 
         text.  The content inside is typically displayed with an underline.
    <b>&lt;pre&gt; Tag:</b>
         The &lt;pre&gt; tag defines preformatted text. Text in a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font, 
         and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in 
         the HTML source code.
    <b>&lt;small&gt; Tag:</b>
         &lt;small&gt; Used for specifying smaller text. 
    <b>&lt;abbr&gt; Tag:</b> 
         The &lt;abbr&gt; element is used along with a title attribute to associate a full-text explanation with an abbreviation 
         or acronym.
    <b>Block level elements:</b>  
         A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and 
         after the element. Two commonly used block elements are: &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; .
    <b>inline elements:</b>  
         Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. 
    <b>BlockQuote:</b>
         The &lt;blockquote&gt; tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
